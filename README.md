# Cracking the Ames Housing Dataset with Linear Regression
Linear regression modelling of the Ames housing dataset (2011), with the chief goal of predicting the house sale price. The analysis is undertaken with transparent linear models where the goals of both prediction and statistical inference may be pursued together. The ordinary least squares (OLS) model achieved stable results and scores, with the OLS coefficients and test scores (R-squared, MSE & RMSE) effectively matching those derived from the Ridge and Lasso regressions. 

The assorted property size variables, namely internal living area, basement finished area, lot area and garage area, were all found to be positively correlated to the sale price, and statistically significant. Build quality and condition were also found to be among the most important determinants of house prices, as was location desirability. The use of the OLS model allows for the simultaneous pursuit of prediction and statistical inference. The overall model and individual variable effects may also be easily communicated to non-technical audiences.
